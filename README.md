# fast_docker
Fast api running in a docker container to upload to aws beanstalk 

Specifically:
my stretch goal for the weekend is to refamiliarize myself with AWS. I am going to do this by creating a fastapi app, running on uvicorn web server(like Mike was using), connected to a postgresql db, where I have route examples for Post Get Put Delete (CRUD), make sure I implement database.fetch_all(query) instead of fetch_one,  put everything into a docker-container and then upload to aws elastic beanstalk to test it out live.
This is exciting puzzle week
